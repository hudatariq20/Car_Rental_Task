# üõµ Authorized Car Rental and Weather App - Flutter, Firebase(SaaS backend), Firebase Firestore, Bloc State Management, Clean Architecture,GeoLocation

### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate **Firebase** **authentication** and **authorization** with BLoC pattern, along with calling the **OpenWeather** **API** to fetch weather details and explore detailed car information. It displays current weather condition (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, Thunderstorm) based on **Geolocation** **API** that fetch exact GPS location of the device. 
 **Firebase's** **Firestore** security rules protect **User** data from unauthorized access and maintains car information that is to be displayed on the car information page.
The app uses **BLoC** for handling state and business logic separately from the UI, ensuring maintainable and scalable code. The **Clean Architecture** pattern is followed to separate concerns between data, domain, and presentation layers.

### üì± Features
* **User Authentication/Authorization** using Firebase (sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out) and Firebase Firestore.
* **Weather Information** fetched using OpenWeather API, based on the user's current location via Geolocation and Geocoding APIs.
* **Car Rental System** with a list of available cars fetched from Firebase, showing the car's specs (fuel per hour, distance, etc.).
*  **BLoC Pattern** used for state management to make the app scalable and easy to maintain.
*  **Vehicle Listing Page**: Display a list of available cars fetched from Firebase.
*  **Vehicle Information Page**: Show detailed information about a selected car.
*  **Validator class** coordinating checks and **Validation** subclasses defining rules,
